	<p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids</p>
	<p>pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but <a href="">because those who</a> do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p>

	<h2>The Idea</h2>
	<h3>How to help students to actively utilize the library resources?</h3>
	<p>Bookclip is an application that helps students to actively utilize the school library by tracking their school portal. ......In contrast to an increasing number of library resources, most of the students were not aware of this availabilities. To reduce the students’ search for their required materials from the classes and to increase the library usage, I designed a system that utilizes the school online portal and the library management system.</p>
	<h3>Bookclip helps students to find and track their library usage.</h3>
	<p>For students to get access to items that is related to their majors and their course registrations, I came up with three key features below.</p>
</div>
<div class="large">
	<div class="clmn3"><h3>Checkout History</h3><p class="support">Users can see the list of items that they checked out with the returning date. Also they can see the details of the book with the time and the library that they visited.</p></div>
	<div class="clmn3"><h3>Recommendations</h3><p class="support">Users will receive recommendations of items based on their search keywords, course registration and their major.</p></div>
	<div class="clmn3"><h3>Search Inbox</h3><p class="support">Search Inbox helps users to find the book by providing maps and decimal codes.</p></div>
</div>
<div>
	<h3>Various Ways to Explore New Items</h3>
	<p>To help students to find items that they can relate to, I separated two different ways of getting recommendation. First, based on the static data like majors, and based on the dynamic data like check out history and course registrations.</p>

	<h2>Execution</h2>
	<h3>Mobile User Flow — Exploring with Less Friction</h3>
	<p>Since on the mobile, various lists categorized with different dataset, it was important for the lists to be easily differentiated from each other, as well as shares the same functionality.</p>

<div>
	<h2>Research</h2>
	<h3>Territory Mapping — Connecting Students with School Libraries.</h3>
	<p>Most of the students knew where the libraries were located at and they’ve been in the libraries a few times, but not many of them rented materials. They usually went to library for studying and group meet-ups. Their reactions on searching and renting out resources were mostly negative and associated with the words like ‘lost’, ‘confused’, and ‘time-consuming’. Interestingly, they were all positive about having the access to those materials and responded that they would use the libraries more often.</p>

<h3>What are the available systems? — Gap Analysis</h3>
<p>There were several library management systems available online. However, they were useful for searching item locations and checking availability. These systems were not for exploring possible materials.</p>
